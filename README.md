# Freshworks_Backend
Backend assignement to create a key-value data store

As GIL allows only one thread to hold control of python interpreter hence it is thread-safe,yet locks can be pass as arguments to the functions.

Unit Test cases has been attached.

As there was no restriction in the type of file to be used, I have used JSON format as the complete backend file.
Function Signature:
create()
read(key)
delete(key)
Database(name[,location])
